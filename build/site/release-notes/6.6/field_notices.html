<p><strong>Critical Vulnerability Security Patch - AVI-2021-0006</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This security patch was made available Monday, October 25th, 2021 at
05:00PM PST. The critical vulnerability addressed by this patch was
privately disclosed to Aviatrix. It affects services of Controller
available on port 443 and would allow an unauthenticated attacker to
execute code on the Controller. This could be mitigated by limiting
access to the https/port 443 of the Controller, or by running a Web
Application Firewall (WAF) in front of it. Please refer to our
documentation to
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/FAQ.html#how-do-i-secure-the-controller-access">secure
the Controller access</a>.</p>

<p><strong>After a Gateway Replace operation on version 6.4 or later, the
Site2Cloud connections on the Gateway might not come up</strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run a "Gateway Replace" operation from a Controller running
version 6.4 or later, on a gateway which was created when this
Controller was running on 6.3 or earlier, the Site2Cloud connections on
this Gateway might not be able to come up</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default IPSec tunnel management software was changed in the
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/image_release_notes.html">Gateway

<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/UCC_Release_Notes.html">version 6.4</a> and
later. Any Gateway which might have been created while running version
6.3 or older will be using the older IPSec tunnel management software.
While the Controller ported the config from the old Gateway to the new
Gateway, one of the field&#8217;s default setting has changed. This setting
could come into play based on the devices that this Gateway has
established Site2Cloud tunnels and might result in the Site2Cloud tunnel
not coming up. This was

<p><strong>Upgrade from 6.3 to 6.4 could cause gateways to be in down/polling

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We had announced in Field Notice
0027(<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/field_notices.html#field-notice-0027-2021-04-29" class="bare">https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/field_notices.html#field-notice-0027-2021-04-29</a>)
that gateway names are required to be 50 characters or less. We have
noticed that during upgrade operations, from 6.3 to 6.4, we are further
limited on the gateway name length to 44 characters due to a new default
behavior introduced in 6.4.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From 6.4, we started using self-signed certs to authenticate
management/control communication between controller and gateways. The
default cert domain used is "aviatrixnetwork.com". This ends up using 20
characters from our internal max of 64 characters - leaving only 44
characters for the gateway names(including "-hagw", if the gateway has
an HA gateway). If the controller has any gateways with names longer
than 44 characters, that gateway and the following gateways in the
upgrade process could show up as "down/polling" state on the gateway
page.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended Solution:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If all your gateway names(including ha gateways) have less than 44

have two options</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>While in 6.3, you can delete them and recreate them with names
shorter than 44 characters (39 chars max, if you plan to have HA
gateway, to account for 5 extra characters in "-hagw" which will be
appended to the HA gateway name)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrade to 6.4. Some gateways will not be in "green/up". To recover,
head to Controller/Onboarding and click in "AWS" icon and enter
"av.com". All gateways should come up in "green/up" status. If not,
please perform "Troubleshoot/Diagnostics/Gateway/ForceUpgrade" on the
affected gateways.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Replace the deprecated gateways and use the new AMIs. To update your
Aviatrix gateways, you may need to upgrade your Aviatrix Controller
first. The Gateway page lists the AMIs for all your gateways. Go to
"Gateway&#8594;Column View&#8594;Select Gateway Image Name&#8594;Apply Columns". For
more information, see
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/image_release_notes.html" class="bare">https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/image_release_notes.html</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Discover all deprecated AMIs. Download the "Generate list of Aviatrix
Gateways using deprecated AMIs" utility from
"Settings&#8594;Maintenance&#8594;Software Patches&#8594;Update Available Patches". Run
this utility to send an email to the admin with a list of all gateways
running deprecated AMI&#8217;s.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We recommend that you replace gateways running Ubuntu14 and Ubuntu16
based AMIs before upgrading to 6.4.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upgrade your Aviatrix Controller to the latest 6.3 release following the
instructions at <a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html" class="bare">https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html</a> and
replace these gateways using the procedures at
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/image_release_notes.html#existing-customers-gateway-image-upgrade" class="bare">https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/image_release_notes.html#existing-customers-gateway-image-upgrade</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also use the following Aviatrix API&#8217;s to replace your gateways
programmatically:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Login and generate CID: curl --location -g --request POST
'https://\{{controller_hostname}}/v1/api' --form 'action="login"'
--form 'username="admin"' --form 'password="\{{admin_password}}"'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the CID generated above to resize gateway and wait till it is
complete, before running on another gateway : curl --location -g
--request POST 'https://\{{controller_hostname}}/v1/api' --form
'action="replace_gateway"' --form 'CID="\{{CID}}"' --form
'gateway_name="\{{gateway_name_in_controller}}"'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the Gateway AMI information: curl --location -g --request GET
'https://\{{controller_hostname}}/v1/api?action=get_gateway_info&amp;CID=\{{CID}}&amp;gateway_name=\{{gateway_name_in_controller}}'</p>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aviatrix strongly recommends that you keep your Aviatrix Network up to
date with the latest releases. We also strongly suggest that you
periodically check the AMI versions on all your gateways and update them
to get the latest fixes for known issues and vulnerabilities.</p>

</div>

<p>Splunk has published a defect and a fix for their products which impacts
the Splunk Forwarder that is integrated into Aviatrix Products. This
will affect your deployment only if you have enabled logging via Splunk.
Please follow the
<a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/FixDatetimexml2020" class="bare">https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/ReleaseNotes/FixDatetimexml2020</a>.[published

<ul>
<li>
<p>Beginning on January 1, 2020, un-patched Splunk platform instances
will be unable to recognize timestamps from events where the date

be indexed with incorrect timestamps.</p>

<p>Beginning on September 13, 2020 at 12:26:39 PM Coordinated Universal

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Recommended Solution:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have a couple of solutions, ordered by our preference:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use rsyslog logging instead of Splunk logging by following the
directions at
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/AviatrixLogging.html#introduction" class="bare">https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/AviatrixLogging.html#introduction</a>. You
can continue to use your current Splunk logging system - the difference
is that they will receive the logs via rsyslog. This method will allow
you to run logging with lower loads on the controllers and gateways and
also keep them insulated from such defects in future as rsyslog is a
very mature logging mechanism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Aviatrix version 5.0 or greater: Please go to
"Controller/Settings/Maintenance/SoftwarePatches" and click on "Update
Available Patches" and patch the "Apply xml file patch for Splunk year
2020 bug". Please verify that the patch is applied by checking the
"Patch Status"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Aviatrix version lower than 5.0: Please upgrade to the latest
release to access our "Software Patches" feature. Please follow the
upgrade instructions at
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html" class="bare">https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Aviatrix Release&gt;=5.3: If Splunk logging is disabled and then
enabled - you don’t have to reapply any patch, as we would install the
latest Splunk forwarder client</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Known Issues:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>After applying the above patch, if a new Gateway is created, you would
have to reapply the patch so that it takes effect on the new gateway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Splunk logging is disabled and then enabled - you would have to
reapply the patch. This applies to only Aviatrix Release 5.2.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We would like to restate our recommendation to use rsyslog to send logs
from your Aviatrix System to your Splunk logging system following these

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A couple of ways to raise local privilege escalation that could result
in a vulnerability were discovered and reported by Alex Seymour of
Immersive Labs, a security research lab, as part of their testing. We
have addressed these vulnerabilities at a high priority as soon as they
were reported to us. We value the contribution and cooperation of such
friendly research labs, their management and staff in making products
better and safer for users across the world. These issues, if exploited,
could allow authenticated users of local machines to execute commands on
the local machine that require higher permission levels, if they did not
have full access to their local computers. These issues impact only the
local machine running the Aviatrix VPN Client on all the operating
systems we support. This vulnerability will not affect local machines
running other OpenVPN Compatible VPN clients. This vulnerability does
not impact local machines for which the users already have administrator
privileges. This vulnerability does not affect the Aviatrix VPN Gateway.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended Solution:</strong></p>
</div>

172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16 routes to on-prem which affects the
on-prem network if the on-prem routers also advertise any of the three
routes. This issue has been fixed in 4.0.590 and all customers who have
deployed TGW are advised to upgrade to 4.0.590 or later, immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Solution: Customers deploying TGW are requested to upgrade to 4.0.590 or
later. Please follow the instructions
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html#how-to-upgrade-software">here</a>
to perform the software upgrade. After upgrading to 4.0.590 or later,
please go to TGW Orchestrator &gt; Plan &gt; Step 7 to detach Aviatrix Transit
GW from TGW and re-attach Aviatrix Transit GW to TGW in Step 6.</p>

<p>Note: this issue does not affect customers who are not deploying TGW
Orchestrator. But if you have plans to deploy, we advise you to upgrade
to the latest software.</p>

<p><strong>Route update propagation inconsistency from on-premise networks
affecting 3.5 releases prior to 3.5.362 for Transit Network</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Problem: BGP Route propagation could fail intermittently from on-premise
networks to cloud networks in Transit Network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Description: Aviatrix controllers and gateways use BGP to summarize and
propagate the network routes. Due to an unexpected software change, 3.5
releases prior to 3.5.362 are affected and cannot forward routes in
certain scenarios. This issue has been addressed in 3.5.362 and all
customers who have deployed Transit Network and are running any 3.5
release prior to 3.5.362 are advised to upgrade to 3.5.362 or later,
immediately. Customers who are running software versions prior to 3.5
are not impacted by this issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Solution: Customers deploying Transit Network are requested to upgrade
to 3.5.362 or later, if they are running any 3.5.(&lt;362) release. Please

<p><strong>SSL UserVPN with SAML function might fail with Chrome v70</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Problem Remote users connecting via SSL UserVPN functionality
authenticated through SAML cannot establish session.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Description Aviatrix controllers and gateways provide SSL UserVPN
service with authentication through SAML as described in
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/VPN_SAML.html">this doc</a>. Google Chrome
v70 has altered the behavior of an element in HTML (they add an extra
whitespace). This affects our product’s ability to interface with the
SAML id providers and breaks the authentication process, resulting in
remoteVPN users not being able to connect to your network. We have
notified Google about this issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Solution Customers deploying SSL UserVPN with SAML authentication are
requested to upgrade to 3.5.362 or later, if they are running 3.3 or
later release. Please follow the instructions
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/inline_upgrade.html#how-to-upgrade-software">here</a>
to perform the software upgrade. For software version prior to 3.3,
please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@aviatrix.com">support@aviatrix.com</a>. Another workaround to
restore the service to your users is to use Firefox as their default
browser.</p>
