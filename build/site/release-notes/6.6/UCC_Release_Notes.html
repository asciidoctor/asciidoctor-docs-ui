<p><strong>Enhanced Features in Release 6.6</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Added support for Aviatrix Spoke Gateway to External Device
(BGP-Enabled Spoke). Introduced in Aviatrix release 6.6, you can now
create spoke gateways that are BGP-enabled and NAT-enabled. Aviatrix
Cloud Network Platform has always supported NAT in a way that most
enterprises need in order to meet their business and technical
requirements. Using BGP-enabled and NAT-enabled spoke gateways gives you
yet more capabilities to implement policy based SNAT/DNAT functions in
strategic places in your network architecture. For more information, see
the discussion about
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/spokegw_external.html">Aviatrix Spoke
Gateway to External Device</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) BGP over LAN to support
multi peer instance. This allows Aviatrix Transit Gateways to
communicate with a pair of instances in the same VPC in GCP without
running any tunneling protocol such as IPSec or GRE. For more
information, see the discussion about
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_gateway_external_device_bgp_over_lan_gcp_workflow.html">GCP
Multi-cloud Transit BGP over LAN Workflow</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for AWS TGW Connect over Direct Connect. Amazon Web
Services (AWS) enables AWS customers to integrate their Software Defined
Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) devices with AWS Transit Gateway and AWS
Direct Connect so they can use their existing SD-WAN devices to connect
their on-premises networks to an AWS Transit Gateway. In support of
this, Aviatrix enables you to create one or multiple Transit Gateway
Connect attachments over Direct Connect. You can also create Transit
Gateway Connect peer attachments. For instructions, see the topic
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/tgwconnect.html">Enable AWS TGW connect
over Direct Connect</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for Aviatrix Controller Security Assertion Markup
Language (SAML) based authentication user VPN access in Azure. For
instructions, see the topic
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/azure_saml_auth_vpn_access.html">Azure
SAML Authorization VPN Access</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for FireNet with PAN in AWS China.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for Checkpoint integration with private SSH keys.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>UI Enhancements in Release 6.6</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved FireNet and Multi-Cloud Transit workflows reducing clicks and
navigation steps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decommissioning and Renaming of CLOUDWAN to CLOUDN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notification bar includes message history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guided “What’s New” information for first Aviatrix Controller user
login.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Launch CoPilot from the Aviatrix Controller App Drawer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable daily backup added to notification menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use consistent naming in action menu and config box for the list view
of Transit Gateway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Changed Behaviors in Release 6.6</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The 6.6 release introduces a behavior change in the Multi-Cloud
Transit Active-Standby Site2Cloud behavior, if the setting is enabled.
After a failover, when the primary gateway is back up, the traffic is
switched over automatically back to the primary Site2Cloud connection.
This brings more predictability and fits into the model of most on-prem
firewalls. In 6.6, this behavior cannot be adjusted. If Active-Standby
is disabled (which is the default setting), there is no behavior change.
If you have questions about this behavior, please contact your Aviatrix
account team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before 6.6, when BGP ECMP is enabled, routes from different domain can
be combined to form ECMP at gateway. This is incorrect behavior and is
fixed in 6.6, such that only BGP routes from the same domain can be
combined for ECMP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aviatrix no longer supports non-ActiveMesh transit network
configurations beginning in release 6.6. Aviatrix recommends that if you
are running version 6.5 or earlier, you upgrade to version 6.5.1922 or a
higher 6.5 version before upgrading to 6.6.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Upgrade Behaviors and Restrictions in Release 6.6</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To upgrade to 6.6, you must manually enter “6.6” in the Aviatrix
Controller upgrade window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot rollback to Aviatrix version 6.5 after upgrading to 6.6.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Known Issues in Release 6.6</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cannot add more than 2 remote and 2 local subnet pair tunnels to a
Site2Cloud policy based connection with the Aviatrix Controller.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Workaround: Use Site2Cloud to delete or add new subnet pair tunnels
to a Site2Cloud policy based connection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>OCI is not yet compatible with the 6.6 release. Until a new image is
available, initializing your controller to the latest will fail.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Workaround: initialize your controller to 6.5 first and upgrade to
6.6. Controllers already installed with 6.3 or newer should be able to
upgrade to 6.6 without issue.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The controller&#8217;s database version and schema are changed in 6.6. You
might notice that there will be a brief period of error messages in the
controller&#8217;s log while this change is happening. The errors should stop
without user intervention after the upgrade is complete.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AVX-16967</strong> - When a SNAT rule is added/removed for a gateway, it
needs to check if the NAT rule is duplicated in the route tables. The
checking is dependent on the NAT routes if load balanced or generic (not
load balanced). You must miss the checking for duplicated routes to
include the HA gateways in the interface list. It may give a wrong
conclusion that some NAT rules were duplicated.</p>

<p><strong>AVX-16151</strong> - The [NAT] incorrect tunnel is used during DNAT rule
programming for Transit Gateway with HA. When DNAT is configured on
non-active-mesh Transit Gateway with "Sync to HA" enabled, the DNAT rule
may not be programmed correctly on HA Gateway and the Transit Gateway

vulnerability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This security patch was made available Monday, October 25th, 2021 at
05:00PM PST. The critical vulnerability addressed by this patch was
privately disclosed to Aviatrix and is not known to be exploited. It
affects services of our Controller available on port 443 and would allow
an unauthenticated attacker to execute code on the controller. This
could be mitigated by limiting access to the https/port 443 of the
Controller, or by running a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of
it.</p>

<p><strong>AVX-15740</strong> - The latest version of the Aviatrix AWS CloudFormation
stack improves security by removing 0.0.0.0 entry on port 443 so the
Aviatrix controller is not open to the world by default. However, this
means related gateway IP entries need to be added to the security group
when a new gateway is deployed for the gateway to talk to controller. To
achieve this automatically, the Controller Security Group Management
feature will be auto enabled when a user creates the first AWS account.

<p><strong>Selective Upgrades</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To facilitate less disruptive upgrades and reduce maintenance windows
Aviatrix provides a rolling selective upgrade process. You can choose to
upgrade all Aviatrix gateways simultaneously or select specific gateways
and regions to upgrade in logical groups conforming to your network
update policies and maintenance windows. For more information, see

<p><strong>Feature Enhancements in Aviatrix Release 6.5</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p><strong>AVX-9881</strong> - Added support for using the same Azure Virtual Network
name and resource group names under different subscriptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AVX-10188</strong> - Added warning message when disabling the import

<p><strong>Modified Behaviors in Aviatrix Release 6.5</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AVX-9894</strong> - Removed deprecated optional custom logging fields for
Splunk, Sumo, and FielBeat from the user interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AVX-10113</strong> - When you import security certificates on the gateways
and controller, the certificate must include the proper FQDN.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example: openssl req -new -subj "/C=GB/CN=foo" -addext

-newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out req.pem</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, you can add the SubjectAlternateName (SAN) tag in the
openssl.cnf file before generating the certificate. The SAN tag makes
sure your certificate includes the SubjectAlternateName which is
validated by the Apache server on the controller. Versions of
UserConnect-6.4 and later require the proper SubjectAlternateName
including altNames be set in the certificates when they are imported. If
the SAN is not specified, importing the certificates fails.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AVX-14009</strong> - Added option to allow all traffic from the local VPC
CIDR block to the network security group created during the OCI gateway
creation process. Previously, only TCP port 443 traffic from the
controller was added to the security group. By default, OCI allows all
traffic from RFC1918 blocks. This change only applies to non-RFC1918 VPC
CIDR block configurations.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This behavior does not affect ActiveMesh gateways. In non-ActiveMesh
environments, only one transit or spoke gateway can have the image
upgraded or the software rolled back at a time. If you select multiple
gateways, you receive an error message. For multiple API calls to
replace gateways using Terraform, only one gateway is allowed and the
others fail. For Terraform calls, Aviatrix recommends you set
parallelism=1.</p>

<p><em>Gateway Issue Discovered After Upgrade</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In rare cases where the controller and a group of gateways are selected
for upgrade and a fatal bug is discovered in the new software, a
situation where the controller and gateways remain running different
versions could develop. If this condition occurs assistance from
Aviatrix Support is required. For example: A controller and gateways are
running version 6.5.200.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You upgrade the controller and a subset of gateways to 6.5.300.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You rollback the gateways to 6.5.200 because of a bug in the 6.5.300
software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now the controller is running 6.5.300 and all gateways are running
6.5.200, and the gateways cannot successfully be upgraded to 6.5.300
because of the bug.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bug is resolved in controller version 6.5.400, so you want to
upgrade to 6.5.400 to resolve the issue. However, this is not supported
because the controller and gateways must be running the same software
version before the controller can be upgraded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In this corner case, you must contact Aviatrix Support to upgrade the
controller to the newer version. Support will diagnose the issue and
provide the API operation required to perform the con-troller upgrade.</p>

<p><strong>Bug fix</strong> This issue is related to our smallest supported instance
size in AWS which is t2.micro. In 6.4 the t2.micro instances were under
additional memory pressure because of new services enabled in 6.4. As a
result, some customers may experience gateway down events after
upgrading to 6.4. This issue resolves those issues by optimizing several
scheduled jobs which burden the t2.micro appliances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhancement</strong> In order to alleviate memory pressure on our smallest
supported AWS instance size; t2.micro, we now enable swap memory on
instances with less than 1G of memory. This allows short periods of
over-provision to be tolerated by the operating system ensuring

<p><strong>Transit in Azure with Express Route</strong> allows you to build an Aviatrix
Transit and Transit FireNet solutions while leveraging the native Azure
Express Route for on-prem to cloud connectivity and route propagation.
One use case is to deploy in an environment where encryption between
data center and cloud is not required but using native high performance
Express Route is required. Both native Spoke VNet and Aviatrix Spoke
gateways are supported as Spoke attachment. For configuration workflow,
follow the

<p><strong>Transit BGP over GRE Tunnel</strong> provides an alternative tunneling
protocol to IPSec when connecting Aviatrix Transit Gateway to on-prem.
One use case is for an organization that requires high performance but
not encryption. With GRE tunneling, Multi-cloud Transit Gateways in AWS
connects with on-prem network devices without deploying Aviatrix CloudN
appliances. Only available in AWS (Azure and GCP do not support GRE).
For configuration information, refer to
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitgw_external.html#how-to-configure">Aviatrix

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transit BGP to LAN</strong> allows Aviatrix Transit Gateways to communicate
with other instances in the same VPC or VNet without running any
tunneling protocol. One use case is to interoperate with cloud virtual
appliances such as a SD-WAN cloud gateway instances that do not have the
capability to support BGP over IPSec or GRE protocols. For configuration
and performance information, refer to
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transit_gateway_external_device_bgp_over_lan_workflow.html">BGP

<p><strong>Active-Standby Mode on ActiveMesh 2.0</strong> provides the flexibility on
Aviatrix Transit Gateways to connect to on-prem with only one active
tunnel and the other one as backup. The use case is a deployment
scenario where on-prem device such as firewalls does not support
asymmetric routing on two tunnels. When Active-Standby mode is enabled,
it applies to both BGP and Static Remote Route Based
<a href="https://docs.aviatrix.com/HowTos/transitgw_external.html">External Device
Connections</a> and for each connection, only one tunnel is active in
forwarding traffic at any given time. To configure, go to Multi-cloud

advertises Spoke CIDRs that are relevant to the on-prem site. This
behavior is enabled as the default when launching a new Transit Gateway.

<p><strong>Spoke VPC Gateway Attach Behavior</strong> is modified such that when a spoke
gateway is attached to the Aviatrix Transit GW, RFC 1918 routes are
programmed. Conversely when a Spoke VPC gateway is detached from the
Aviatrix Transit GW, all learned routes are deleted. Such behavior
change simplifies migration process from Aviatrix Encrypted Transit
architecture to AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) based transit architecture.
Backward compatibility is ensured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Gateway Launch</strong> no longer creates a new resource, instead it
now re-uses VNET resource. The use case is customers already created a
resource group when creating a VNET.</p>

<p>First release to white list public Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN
filtering) for egress HTTP and HTTPS traffic to Internet initiated by
instances on private subnets in a VPC. The FQDNs can be specified with
regex wild card, such as *.example.com. A tag is defined as a list of
FQDNs and one or more gateways is attached to a tag. Any updates to a
tag automatically triggers updates to all gateways attached to the tag.
Multiple tags can be defined on the controller. This feature works
together with Gateway Security Policy feature where private network, IP
address, protocol and ports can be filtered.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To configure, go to "Advanced Config" &#8594; "FQDN Filter". The workflow is
1) create a tag, 2) Click Enable to enable the tag, 3) Edit the tag by
adding FQDN hostname part of URLs (e.g.
<a href="http://www.aviatrix.com">www.aviatrix.com</a>, or *.google.com), and 4)
Attach Gateway. One or more gateways can be attached to a tag. Step 1),
3) and 4) can be done first and then Enable the tag. Once the tag is
enabled, HTTP and HTTPS traffic to these FQDN will be allowed, and any
destination outside the FQDN will be denied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the gateway with FQDN must have NAT enabled for Internet egress
traffic.</p>

<p>First release of Service Chaining. Service Chaining capability allows
multiple instance based functions to work in tandem to control traffic
flow path within an AWS VPC. For example, a firewall instance can be
service chained with Aviatrix gateway so that EC2 initiated traffic will
first be sent to firewall for inspection before forwarding it to
Aviatrix gateway for peering to another VPC. To enable the function, go
to "Advanced Config" &#8594; "Service Chaining" to select the route table and
enter "Downstream IP". Aviatrix gateway will only modify the selected
route table to specify which outgoing traffic needs to go through itself
and also route the incoming traffic to the "Downstream IP" address.
Normally, the selected route table is associated with the subnet of your
firewall&#8217;s WAN (or untrusted) interface. The "Downstream IP" should be
the IP address of your firewall&#8217;s WAN interface. For details, check out
<a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aviatrix-download/Cloud-Controller/Aviatrix+Service+Chaining+Reference+Design.pdf">this</a>
reference design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within AWS, support has been added to allow deployment of the UCC
Controller in VPC&#8217;s private subnet. To enable this, during the
Controller&#8217;s initial setup, when prompted for "If this controller is
being launched on a private subnet, check the box below, otherwise,
leave it blank", select "private subnet" and then click the "save"
button. Please note that when the Controller is deployed in private
subnet it can only create gateways in private subnets. We assume these
private subnets in various VPCs can reach each other through AWS
peering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For AWS, account diagnostics have been added. To run these
diagnostics, go to Troubleshoot &#8594; Diagnostics &#8594; "Account Diagnostics".
This diagnostics command will validate the AWS account credentials and
check the status of associated gateways and SQS queues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is now support for adding multiple CIDRs separated by commas in
"Advanced Config"&#8594;"Join Function" &#8594; "Allow Subnet" at CloudN.</p>

gateway on the "Gateway" page and then go to "Gateway for High
Availability Tunnel/Peering" to create a backup gateway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support has been added to allow the creation of two VPN gateways
(without ELB) in the same VPC, one with SAML enabled and the other one
with only certification authentication enabled (no MFA method supported
on the 2<sup>nd</sup> gateway).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Dashboard now displays the IPSec tunnels created by site2cloud
connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support has been added for enabling NAT on CloudN Controller itself.

public IP are displayed. To view these public IP addresses, go to
Troubleshoot &#8594; Diagnostics &#8594; "Controller Public IP".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proxy server support has been added on the UCC Controller for initial
download and ongoing communication. During the Controller&#8217;s initial
setup, when prompted for "If the controller accesses the Internet
through a proxy server, provide the following information, otherwise
leave the fields blank", enter the server URLs for "HTTP Proxy" and
"HTTPS Proxy". If the proxy server issues a self-signed certificate,
upload a CA certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to setup proxy server setting for Internet connectivity in
CloudN OVA has been added. To configure proxy server support, use
"–setup_network_only \{true|false}" for clish command
setup_interface_address and setup_interface_static_address. Use clish
command "setup_network_options \{test|save|cancel}" to test/save/remove
http/https proxy setting. Currently, "Datacenter Extension" and "Join
Function" are not supported when proxy server is enabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traceroute support has been added on gateways. To run "Trace Route",
go to Troubleshoot &#8594; Logs &#8594; "Traceroute Utility".</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>From AWS/Azure/GCloud controller, you can now launch a gateway in
GCloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GCloud account creation, editing and deletion</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Edit configuration (LDAP, DHCP, and Split Tunnel) on existing gateway</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support the ability to edit the split tunnel mode on existing VPN
gateways. Previously, to make any split tunnel related configuration
changes, users have to delete the existing VPN gateways and re-create
new ones. With this release, when you add a new VPC/VNet and your VPN
users need to access them via VPN, you just modify the CIDRs at
“additional CIDRs” field at split tunnel configuration without deleting
any existing gateways. To configure, go to VPC/VNet &#8594; Edit
Configuration&#8594; Modify Split Tunnel. Note all additional CIDRs (the
CIDRs that are not the VPC/VNet CIDR where VPN gateways are deployed)
must be entered all together, separated by comma. For example, you have
two new VPCs, 10.10.0.0/16 and 10.11.0.0/16, and you like to access them
via split tunnel VPN. You must enter at the Modify Split Tunnel field
“10.10.0.0/16,10.11.0.0/16” without the quote. In addition, you may need
to add encrypted peering with the new VPCs in order for traffic to go
through. The changes are effective immediately to the VPN gateway in the
VPC/VNet. If there are multiple VPN gateways behind a load balancer,
they are all updated at the same time. Active VPN users will be
disconnected during this configuration time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support Transitive Peering. Transitive Peering enables you to route
traffic from instances in Source VPC, encrypted, through a NextHop VPC
gateway to reach a destination. Before creating Transitive Peering’, you
need to make Encrypted Peering between Source VPC and NextHop VPC first.
To create/delete Transitive Peering, go to VPC/VNet &#8594; Encrypted Peering
&#8594; Transitive Peering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support site to cloud IPSec VPN connections. Using this feature, you
can create IPSec VPN connections linking your on-prem networks to
VPC/VNets in the cloud. To configure, go to VPC/VNet &#8594; Site2Cloud.
After adding a site2cloud connection, you can download a configuration
template file for your on-prem devices (Only Cisco ASA configuration
template is available now). If High Availability (HA) function is
enabled, one gateway serves as the primary VPN connection endpoint and
the other one serves as the backup. In case on-prem device loses the VPN
connection to the primary VPN gateway, it can switch to the backup
gateway to recover the VPN connection. Some diagnostic tools for
site2cloud are also provided.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support encryption for Azure ExpressRoute. This feature allows to run
IPSec over Azure Express Route to ensure a higher security level. To
enable it, first launch a gateway in a subnet dedicated for the gateway,
then go to VPC/VNet &#8594; Site2Cloud, click “Add” tab and select “Private
Route Encryption”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support VNet route diagnostics. Go to Settings &#8594; Troubleshooting &#8594;
VNet Route Diagnostics to find various VNet routing related diagnostics
tools.</p>

this feature to import certificates and download VPN configuration
files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support the ability to edit the LDAP settings on existing VPN
gateways. Previously, to make any LDAP related configuration changes,
users have to delete the existing VPN gateways and re-create new ones.
